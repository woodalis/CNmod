Our control over the steppes depends on maintaining their already questionable loyalty, but their natural proficiency at mounted warfare has been of immense aid to the Empire."

 estate_liao_khans_nomadic_privileges_desc:0 "For centuries, Central Asian politics have been dominated by the various nomadic khanates that roam the steppes terrorizing the sedentary population. Though the Imperial Government has managed to enforce an end to the raids (inter-tribal wars, however, were not prohibited), we had to grant the Khans a variety of concessions in return. As long as the power of the nomads does not diminish, the Empire cannot effectively administer it's frontiers and hinterlands.\n\n§MAs long as this privilege is active, inter-tribal wars will periodically occur!§!\n\n§RNew technological advances, particularly in the field of firearms, may finally give the settled population the upper hand against the nomads! Such an upset is bound to cause unrest, however...§!"

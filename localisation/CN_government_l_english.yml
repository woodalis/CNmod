 SUH_united_emirates_desc:0 "The Suhraltanubian State is a patchwork mess of Emirates and Aboriginal autonomies, governed by an assembly of Emirs commonly known as the 'United Emirates' (of al-Suhraltanubia). This parliament has over time organized a system of elections to select a head of the country from amongst themselves, creating a mostly stable, even if informal, system of oligarchic democracy."

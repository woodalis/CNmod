  waldensian: "Waldensian"
  waldensian_religion_desc: "Originally a reform movement within the Catholic church, the Waldensians were forced to turn anti-clerical following their excommunication and advocated for a return to vows of poverty and earlier forms of Christianity. The religion takes its name from its founder Peter Waldo, who began preaching in Lyon and surrounding areas in the 12th century. Waldensians are opposed to capital punishment and believe that laymen can also administer the sacraments. The Protestants eventually considered Waldensians as precursors to the Reformation.\n\nIn the game the Waldensian faith has been significantly cut down by repression and mostly survives in the remote mountainous regions of Piedmont and Arpitania."

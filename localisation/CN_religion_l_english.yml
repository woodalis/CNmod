  waldensian: "Waldensian"
  waldensian_religion_desc: "Originally a reform movement within the Catholic church, the Waldensians were forced to turn anti-clerical following their excommunication and advocated for a return to vows of poverty and earlier forms of Christianity. The religion takes its name from its founder Peter Waldo, who began preaching in Lyon and surrounding areas in the 12th century. Waldensians are opposed to capital punishment and believe that laymen can also administer the sacraments. The Protestants eventually considered Waldensians as precursors to the Reformation.\n\nIn the game the Waldensian faith has been significantly cut down by repression and mostly survives in the remote mountainous regions of Piedmont and Arpitania."

  #Lollard
  lollard: "Lollard"
  lollard_religion_desc:0 "Lollards are members of the movement which came to be known as Lollardy, a movement based originally on the teachings of John Wycliffe and which laid much of the groundwork for not just other reformers like Jan Hus but for the greater Protestant Reformation in total. Wycliffe and his peers believed not just in the use of the vernacular in scripture - indeed, Wycliffe oversaw the first translations of the Bible into Middle English - but also in the doctrine of \"sola scriptura\" which would later underpin Lutheranism and other Protestant denominations. Lollardy's advocacy for anti-clerical reform garnered support from the peasantry and many academics at Oxford and elsewhere throughout Great Britain as well as from some members of the English nobility, who saw the confiscation of church property as an attractive way to gain income from England's monasteries."

  # Ukonusko
  ukonusko: "Ukonusko"
  ukonusko_religion_desc:0 "Ukonuskoists are followers of the native religion of the Finno-Ugric peoples. Believing in a varied pantheon which changes from locality to locality, all Ukonuskoists nevertheless believe in the supremacy of Ukko. The spirits of the dead, good and bad, travel to Tuonela, a realm sectioned off from the overworld via a great river. Shamans have the power to travel to and from Tuonela to communicate with these spirits and ask what sacrifices are needed to heal people or bring good fortunes; the sacrifices restore the balance between the mortal and immortal worlds. These sacrifices take place at holy natural sites such as sacred forests and large, unusually shaped rocks."

  nestorian_religion_desc:0 "The Church of the East, also called the Nestorian Church, is a christian denomination that split from mainstream christianity in the early 5th century. Initially most Nestorian Christians lived in Persia and Mesopotamia, but the religion spread eastwards over the centuries, eventually reaching as far as China and India.\n\nDue to repeated persecution and suppression, the Church eventually began to decline, and by 1415 has been reduced to minor communities of faithful mostly residing in the Western Liao Empire, the government apparatus of which the Church has strongly tied itself to in an attempt to ensure the faith's survival."

  # Humlian
  humlian: "Humlian"
  humlian_religion_desc:0 "Arrising rather quietly in the borderlands of Catholicism and Orthodoxy, the independent Church of Bosnia came into being in the 11th century and expanded throughout the center of the country. Its formation was one formed largely of neglect for the region by the Papacy and a desire to ensure Bosnian independence from Hungarian influence which was being exerted religiously. The church combined elements of Catholicism and Orthodoxy with some inspirations from Bogomilism, though was ultimately a splinter of the Roman Catholic Church in its majority. Several crusades and inquisitions imposed on Bosnia have proven rather ineffective, and the Humlian faith still resides within Bosnia and Herzegovina as the 15th century progresses."

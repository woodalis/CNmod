  waldensian: "Waldensian"
  waldensian_religion_desc: "Originally a reform movement within the Catholic church, the Waldensians were forced to turn anti-clerical following their excommunication and advocated for a return to vows of poverty and earlier forms of Christianity. The religion takes its name from its founder Peter Waldo, who began preaching in Lyon and surrounding areas in the 12th century. Waldensians are opposed to capital punishment and believe that laymen can also administer the sacraments. The Protestants eventually considered Waldensians as precursors to the Reformation.\n\nIn the game the Waldensian faith has been significantly cut down by repression and mostly survives in the remote mountainous regions of Piedmont and Arpitania."

  #Lollard
  lollard: "Lollard"
  lollard_religion_desc:0 "Lollards are members of the movement which came to be known as Lollardy, a movement based originally on the teachings of John Wycliffe and which laid much of the groundwork for not just other reformers like Jan Hus but for the greater Protestant Reformation in total. Wycliffe and his peers believed not just in the use of the vernacular in scripture - indeed, Wycliffe oversaw the first translations of the Bible into Middle English - but also in the doctrine of \"sola scriptura\" which would later underpin Lutheranism and other Protestant denominations. Lollardy's advocacy for anti-clerical reform garnered support from the peasantry and many academics at Oxford and elsewhere throughout Great Britain as well as from some members of the English nobility, who saw the confiscation of church property as an attractive way to gain income from England's monasteries."

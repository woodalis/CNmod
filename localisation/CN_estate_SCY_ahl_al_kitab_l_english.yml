The peoples explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an are the Jews, Christians and Sabians. In Islamic jurisprudential tradition, more groups are sometimes considered to be People of the Book, such as Zoroastrians. The Ahl al-Kitab, being part of the monotheistic community, are obligated to be well treated by Muslims, though tensions between communities can and do often reach violence."

Even if misguided, their unshaken belief in Allah shows that they are worthy of protection. Through the Qur'an and by Muhammad's example, our obligations to the Ahl al-Kitab are clear and change could cause much uproar.\n\n§ROverturning this privilege could upset more than just the Ahl al-Kitab!§!"

The peoples explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an are the Jews, Christians and Sabians. In Islamic Jurisprudence tradition, more groups are sometimes considered to be People of the Book, such as Zoroastrians. The Ahl al-Kitab, being part of the monotheistic community, are obligated to be well treated by Muslims, though tensions between communities can and do often reach violence."

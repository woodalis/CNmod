 CSH_rise_of_the_dashing_king_desc:0 "Li Zicheng, also known as the 'Dashing King', is a charismatic military commander who has widespread support among the peasants for his policy of aiding the poor and only attacking enemy armies and officials.

 CSH_nestorian_influence:0 "Metropolitanate of Lanzhou"
 CSH_nestorian_influence_desc:0 "The Nestorian Christian Church in Xibei has a complicated relationship with our government. Though many see it as an extension of the Western Liao spreading the Khitan's influence into Xibei, there are undeniable benefits to co-operating with the church. In exchange for us tolerating their presence in Xibei, they have been providing us with invaluable intelligence about our enemies."
 CSH_gao_guiying:0 "Gao Guiying"
 CSH_gao_guiying_desc:0 "Gao Guiying, the wife of Li Zicheng, has raised and trained the female troops within our army with great effectiveness. Though female military commanders are exceptionally rare in China, Gao has more than proven her worth to the Shun."

 CSH_fight_famine_rebuild_country_desc:0 "It was famine and disease that allowed the Shun to rise.

 LIA_battle_of_qatwan_desc:0 "After Yelü Dashi and his Liao exiles defeated the Qarakhanid Khanate during their invasion of Central Asia, the Qarakhanid Khan called upon his overlord in the Seljuq Empire for aid, who promptly marched to Samarqand with a force of 100.000 men, led personally by the Seljuq sultan. Yelü Dashi, despite only having a force barely a third as large, chose to engage the Seljuqs head-on and defeated them with encircling maneuvers.\n\nThe crushing victory over the Seljuqs cemented our power in Central Asia and started the historic rivalry between the Liao and the Seljuqs, one that continues to this day."
 LIA_liao_religious_freedom:0 "Huaxei"
 LIA_liao_religious_freedom_desc:0 "Central Asia is a land of many religions. Our subjects practice Islam, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, Nestorianism, and much more. Ourselves being not adherent to any of these faiths, we have made efforts to ensure that every subject of the Empire is able to practice their religion freely without intervention from the Imperial Government."
 LIA_gunpowder_empire:0 "The Gunpowder Empire"
 LIA_gunpowder_empire_desc:0 "Rifles, cannons, rockets, mines: the Liao Arsenal has become filled with weapons of gunpowder.\nThe wars in Europe have made the power of firearms and artillery obvious for all to see, and yet, many states still continue to cling on to ancient ways of war. Let their failure be our advantage, the Liao will become experts in the ways of modern warfare."
 LIA_silk_crossroads:0 "Silk Crossroads"
 LIA_silk_crossroads_desc:0 "The Silk Road has rarely ever been so prosperous. Our campaigns of conquest and pacification have revitalized the old trans-Eurasian trade routes between the steppes, Arabia, India and China, and as the middlemen in these mercantile arrangements, we are able to command a great deal of influence in the realm of trade."
 LIA_bureaucratic_empire:0 "Bureaucratic Empire"
 LIA_bureaucratic_empire_desc:0 "The heart of the Liao has always been its bureaucracy. It is this administrative monster that keeps our incredibly diverse and vast realm united and running smoothly in the face of rebellion, famine, chaos and war. As long as the bureaucracy keeps running, so does the Great Liao."
 LIA_economic_planning:0 "Economic Planning"
 LIA_economic_planning_desc:0 "The state does not bend to greedy merchants and bankers. Though they may claim that the economy is best left to those who know it as well as they do, we cannot trust them to always make the best decision for the Empire. The government must take a more active role in ensuring prosperity for it's myriad subjects, starting in the realm of economics."
 LIA_imperial_reorganization:0 "Era of Imperial Reorganization"
 LIA_imperial_reorganization_desc:0 "The 'Era of Imperial Reorganization' was a time of great upheaval in the Empire. The once powerful Imperial Army had stagnated, while the long-standing policy of bureaucratic centralism had become less and less respected in the face of growing bureaucratic corruption. By 1773 however, Emperor Yelü Zhou had grown fed up with the complacency of imperial officials, and ordered that a grand purge of corrupt officials be conducted. Though initially many were suspicious, believing this to be a way of purging anti-imperial individuals, their worries were eventually proven wrong as Emperor Zhou increasingly began adopting many of the recommendations made.\n\nThough the Reformer-Emperor eventually passed in 1806, the Era of Imperial Reorganization continued. The finance and banking systems were overhauled and modernized, criminal and civil codes were updated, new ministries were established, homosexuality and several traditions previously considered 'barbarian' were legalized, an Imperial Citizenship was established, and much more."

 SMR_liao_frontier_desc:0 "Samarqand is located on the very edge of the Great Liao, and beyond our borders lies the madman Caliph who would sooner destroy his own realm than make peace with Balashagun. Guarding the Frontier, holding until the last man: that is our duty to the Empire, and only in death does our duty end."
 SMR_restore_samarqand_observatory:0 "Restore the Observatory"
 SMR_restore_samarqand_observatory_desc:0 "There are many things humanity does not know about the operations of the stars and the sun, of the planets and the world. Though it may still be centuries until we can definitively know the answers to even a fraction of the questions that the stars hold, we can leave our mark on the road there by restoring the famous Samarqand Observatory, surely to become a place of great scientific advancements."
 SMR_bank_of_samarqand:0 "Bank of Samarqand"
 SMR_bank_of_samarqand_desc:0 "Samarqand has always lagged behind the rest of the Empire in economic terms. The region received less attention than most others from the Imperial Government, partially due to the awkward administrative arrangements surrounding the country. No more! Balashagun has at last established a government-backed moneylending institution with the expressed purpose of financing promising development projects in the region."
 SMR_liao_renaissance:0 "The Liao Renaissance"
 SMR_liao_renaissance_desc:0 "In few places is the Liao Renaissance more visible than in Samarqand. The influx of Persian and European scholars has brought about a golden age of culture and science, and we would be fools not to take advantage by hiring a few of these great minds."
 SMR_imperial_auxilliaries:0 "Fuzhuda"
 SMR_imperial_auxilliaries_desc:0 "Pacifying Persia in the aftermath of the Anxi Wars was never going to be easy. As the continued resistance began to take a toll on the Liao forces, they increasingly called upon soldiers from Samarqand to serve in the pacification campaign. Many of these men have returned home as experienced veterans, bringing a great benefit to our military capabilities."
 SMR_metropolitanate_of_samarqand:0 "Metropolitanate of Samarqand"
 SMR_metropolitanate_of_samarqand_desc:0 "The Nestorian Church has a complicated relationship with Samarqand. The majority of our population follows their faith, but rebellion would only bring about Imperial intervention. As such, both parties have mostly chosen to work with each other rather than to fight each other: the Nestorians are able to practice their religion with little restrictions, and in exchange we get to take advantage of the church's extensive connections in the Imperial Court and the christian communities all across the Middle East." 
 SMR_northern_capital:0 "The Northern Capital"
 SMR_northern_capital_desc:0 "Though the Liao's center of power eventually shifted out of Central Asia and into Mesopotamia, Samarqand's influence as a major trade city and popular vacation destination for Emperors remained. This arrangement of the city being an unofficial second capital was legitimized when the city was declared the northern capital of the Liao, and Samarqand (now 'Beijing') only continued to gain in renown afterwards."

 SUH_suhraltanubi_trade_desc:0 "Living just beyond the Spice Islands, the people of Suhraltanubia have over time developed a strong maritime and mercantile culture. From Malacca to Guangzhou, there is scarcely a harbour in East Asia where you cannot find a Suhraltanubian trader."
 SUH_crab_fighting:0 "Crab Fighting"
 SUH_crab_fighting_desc:0 "Ready, Set, Go!!\n\nDue to the oppressive heat and lack of vast swathes of agricultural land, cock-fighting can't be supported as a sport in the vast majority of the nation, therefore to the beaches it is! Inspired by tales of giant crabs living on an island to the west, crab-fighting is a new sport, wherein the fiercest crabs with the biggest claws are made to fight in an enclosed ring. This new sport will spread across the Walythian Islands, and be enjoyed by all for generations to come!"
 SUH_outback_ranchers:0 "Frontier Ranchers"
 SUH_outback_ranchers_desc:0 "The interior of Suhraltanubia is vast and sparsely populated. Despite this, our people continue to settle further and further inland, creating vast livestock farms in the inland. These ranches are able to autonomously develop their land where the government is unable to, turning a vast dry grassland into a profitable grazing area."
 SUH_el_diab:0 "Walbreieu el-Diab"
 SUH_el_diab_desc:0 "The name Walbreieu el-Diab is one that every Suhraltanubian will immediately recognize, for there have been few greater minds to ever inhabit this world. In a voyage funded by the Akgulid Caliph, el-Diab set out from the Red Sea for the Spice Islands and then his homeland of Suhraltanubia. From here, it was onwards further to the east and south through Polynesia and along a newly discovered coast which he rounding, ultimately crossing the straits of Gibraltar under the cover of darkness to finally arrive in Alexandria.\n\nHe will go down in the pages of history as a great explorer, as the first man to sail a fleet around the globe, and his example will inspire many Suhraltanubians even long after his death."
 SUH_polynesian_integration:0 "Polynesian Integration"
 SUH_polynesian_integration_desc:0 "The people of Walytha are diverse and distant from another, creating a vast array of unique traditions and cultures. To create a truly Walythan state, we must learn from, convert, and integrate all of them."

 SUH_walythian_empire_desc:0 "The Walytha Ocean is vast, and it's islands are many. If we are to rule and defend such a vast and fractured land, we must construct the greatest fleet the world has ever seen. Walytha shall remain free!"
 SUH_marine_corps:0 "Suhraltanubian Marines"
 SUH_marine_corps_desc:0 "Fighting in Walytha is vastly different than in the great landmasses of Eurasia and Avalon. Land warfare plays second fiddle to the control of the seas. \n\nUnlike the continental powers, we have long adapted to this insular style of warfare. Not only are our regular soldiers faster at boarding and unboarding, we have also established the famous Suhraltanubian Marines, a corps of elite soldiers specializing in naval landings and insular warfare."

 SCY_vassals:0 "Kharægat"
 SCY_vassals_desc:0 "The 'Kharægat' of the Scytho-Rus' Khaganate are our border vassals, vital forces in securing the hinterlands of the Khaganate from other hordes and dangerous separatists.

 SCY_exploitation_of_the_slavs:0 "Exploitation of the Slavs"
 SCY_exploitation_of_the_slavs_desc:0 "The Slavic components of our Khaganate are instrumental to our economy. The steppes are wild and nomadic, whereas the forests of Eastern Europe provided the Scythians with an easy opportunity to usurp settled institutions established by the Kievan-Rus'. It is for this reason that most of the Khaganate's taxes come from Slavs."
 SCY_alim:0 "Khagan Alim Saurmag"
 SCY_alim_desc:0 "In the year 1468, the Khagan Alim Saurmag came to power. While his rule was tumultuous and filled with revolt, the country came out more enlightened than ever. Alim was a humanitarian and had controversial thoughts on religion, pushing through orders and edicts that saw the beginning of tolerance for the Khaganate's religious and ethnic minorities, something which was strongly opposed by Scythian and Turkic elites at the time. \n\nKhagan Alim would go down in history as the most influential ruler the Scytho-Rus' ever had."
 SCY_conquest_of_siberia:0 "Conquest of Sybirkhær"
 SCY_conquest_of_siberia_desc:0 "Siberia has always been a desire to many of our border settlers, notably for the lucrative fur trade found there. Cries for governmental action became stronger from Turkic components of the elite who wished to see the incorporation of their northern brethren into the Khaganate. There will never be a better time to sponsor the advance east."
 SCY_modernizing_an_empire:0 "Modernizing an Empire"
 SCY_modernizing_an_empire_desc:0 "This empire is one that stretches the borders of Europe and Asia, and as such is trapped between these worlds culturally and technologically. While in the past our proud Scythian heritage and nomadic tradition won victory in battle, it is clear that archers on horseback are not as effective as they used to be. With the armies of Europe conquering the world, it is time to adapt and embrace the West."
 SCY_expansion_of_liberties:0 "Expansion of Liberties"
 SCY_expansion_of_liberties_desc:0 "As the centuries wore on, the divide between the Khaganate's ethnic groups became to wear down, both through assimilation and acceptance. Notably, far greater autonomy was given to Slavic and Turkic components of the Empire, which began to form a more mutually beneficial arrangement for the Khaganate's elite and the groups that made it up."

We would be wise to utilize these troops wherever possible."

 SLJ_the_mad_caliph_desc:0 "Beginning in 1468, the Caliph Ikram Al-e Seljuq II began a series of confrontations collectively known as the Seljuqid Mad Wars. They were largely aimless, sudden, and incredibly ambitious military operations that mostly ended with failure at the hands of the Akgulids, Musaids, Liao, and Anxyanao. These defeats came with a silver lining, however - the Caliphate had never before seen such levels of potential for expansion and heavy mobilization; the Mad Caliph reinvigorated a martial culture in the Empire."
 SLJ_the_caliphate:0 "The Caliphate"
 SLJ_the_caliphate_desc:0 "While for some years in our conquests the title of Caliph was contested, the death of the Abbasids in Cairo in 1364 and the creation of the Beylik of Egypt saw all rivals removed. From that day forward there would be only one Caliphate: the Seljuqids of Isfahan. \n\nThis title carries with it the weight of dynasties great and powerful, to join their ranks is an eternal honor."

 SLJ_global_navy_desc:0 "From the shores of Al-Andalus to Kalbid Italy, from the Red Sea to the Black, and from the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Qarn Jadid, our fleets sail in the name of the Seljuqs and in the name of Allah.\n\n The Fleet of Islam must grow if it is to secure Muslim trade and sovereignty around the globe."
 SLJ_expand_administration:0 "Expand the Administration"
 SLJ_expand_administration_desc:0 "The Caliphate is large, diverse, and unruly beast from a governmental perspective. While it is true that faith in Allah is enough to hold this Empire together, it wouldn't hurt to give Him some help. We need to expand the rule of beys and imams under the Caliph to make room in our burgeoning borders."
 SLJ_lord_of_all_muslims:0 "Lord of All Muslims"
 SLJ_lord_of_all_muslims_desc:0 "As Caliph, our ruler is the Lord of All Muslims. \n\nThis truth shows itself in the rule over Mecca and Medina, in the cries for reinforcement that ring out of Iberia, in the wars waged against the Princeley Confederation, and in the humble Quanzhou merchant who seeks our protection. Muhammad has never had a better shield."
 SLJ_birlik:0 "Birlik"
 SLJ_birlik_desc:0 "Our state is one built upon unity, not just untiy of Islam, but the unity of the Oghuz. Our elite is largely made up of Turks, Azeris, and Turkmens, all of close relation and cultural background. \n\nThe unity of the Oghuz will ensure loyalty in our realm evermore."

Thousands upon thousands of Oirat Mongol soldiers and horsemen poured into the region as to prepare for a campaign against the Scythians, but the defeat by the Liao and emergence of the Nogai fractured our empire before the Kalmyk campaign could begin. In the chaos, Mongols from Central Asia and Oirats from the homeland increasingly populated the eastern bank of the Volga, forming the periphery haven which has persisted to the modern day. \n\nAt the end of the day, we are just as much an heir to Genghis Khan as the pompous Yuan, and our army shows it."

 KMK_battle_of_samara:0 "Battle of Samara"
 KMK_battle_of_samara_desc:0 "The Battle of Samara in 1378 saw Kalmyk forces engage Scytho-Rus' defenders successfully at the river port. For decades there had been on-and-off hostilities across the Volga of little consequence, but the Kalmyk victory and high casualties sustained in it made both the Scythians and Kalmyks wary of further fighting. \n\nFrom that day forward, a period of peace and understanding would last evermore, slowly bringing the combatants into more friendly relation."

 KMK_the_frontier:0 "The Frontier"
 KMK_the_frontier_desc:0 "In the Scytho-Rus' conquest of Siberia, the Kalmyks played a crucial role. As the (originally) easternmost subject of the Scythians, the Kalmyks were often the ones responsible for establishing the earliest settlements in the steppe and taiga. The Kalmyk cultural proximity to the Oirat and Buryats also acted to incentivize this arrangement through which a Mongolic equivalent to Slavic Cossacks was formed."

 BSH_fort_murtaza:0 "Fort Murtaza"
 BSH_fort_murtaza_desc:0 "Three times the Scythians tried to climb our mountains, and three times they were sent tumbling down. \n\nFort Murtaza sits in the Western Urals, and is a masterpiece of architecture. Lying at the entrance to many passes, it must be overtaken to safely cross into Bashkiria from the Volga Basin, and as such was a prime target for Scythian expansion in the 15th and 16th centuries. The numerous Bashkir victories stalled Scytho-Rus' expansion into Siberia and reinforced a proud identity for our people."

 BSH_northern_route:0 "Northern Route"
 BSH_northern_route_desc:0 "While not direct nor necessarily swift, the passes of the Urals are home to some branches of the Silk Road. The proximity to the Volga makes Bashkiria a more promising route towards reaching Russia and the Baltic than one might assume, but that is not its true strength. The stable nature of our khanate and its fierce yet respectable reputation makes the northern route one of the safest a caravan can take: one that is out of the hands of Nogai and Kazakh bandits."
 BSH_bashkir_khan:0 "The Bashkir Khan"
 BSH_bashkir_khan_desc:0 "The Bashkir Khan is far more powerful than any of the long gone Bulgar ones. Why? Because he is local!

 BSH_mountain_desc:0 "It is in our military doctrine and in our folklore that one must be like a mountain. The Ural-Batyr, while not in agreement with Islam, is our national epic. It tells stories of a hero named Ural who fights demons, resists tyrannical khans, rides a winged steed, and encounters all sorts of beasts and legendary figures on his adventure to ultimately form the mountains for which he is named. \n\nWe should strive to be as strong as Ural and his mountains, for our future may very well be dictated by lessons of the past."

 BSH_tatar_mercenaries_desc:0 "While our relationship with the Kazani and Siberian Tatars is not always the most amicable, we are ultimately brothers, and family helps eachother in their time of need. Tatar mercenaries have a long history throughout Russia and the steppe, and Bashkiria is no exception. Within our borders they are treated well and fall in line seamlessly with our military. It is even better then that they are also highly effective."

 KRS_rebuild_desc:0 "In 1383, the Crimean Tatars under the leadership of Tokhtamysh raided into our city and destroyed it in its entirety. Soon afterwards we appealed to the Lithuanians for protection, who happily sought retribution and conquered the Khanate. Though the threat may be gone and decades have passed, the city still does not live up to its former glory. Let us rebuild a new Kursk, greater than ever before!"

The first is the eastern Kursk, presented to the Scytho-Rus' as a pragmatic ally who is willing to bend the rules where hostile Russians aren't. The second is the western Kursk, presented to the Poles and Lithuanians as a bastion of Christendom and a reliable ally on the frontier. By playing these two powers against eachother we have managed to maintain our independence where others have failed."

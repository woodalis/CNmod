 BJA_lineage_of_two_gods:0 "Lineage of Two Gods"
 BJA_lineage_of_two_gods_desc:0 "The Bjarmian nation is one dominated by two Gods: the native Uko and the honorary Allah. While there are other, lesser gods in the pantheon, it is undeniable that the Green Bolt has become the religious embodiment of the Bjarmian spirit."
 BJA_sintmaogeus:0 "Sintmäogeus"
 BJA_sintmaogeus_desc:0 "Our birthright is a vast and noble one. Surrounding Bjarmaland lie thieves - the Rus', the Turks, the Nords - who wish to take this from us. May we forever strike first to take back and protect what is ours."
 BJA_multicultural_delegates:0 "Multicultural Delegates"
 BJA_multicultural_delegates_desc:0 "Our proud Uralic traditions and respectable lifestyle combined with the prestige and connections of the Scythians have made the diplomats of Bjarmaland well known for their charisma."

 BJA_ukkos_bolt_desc:0 "The God of the sky and lightning, the great Uko, has left many lessons for our armed forces. Among the most important, strike first, strike quickly, and strike like a lightning bolt!"
 BJA_arctic_fleet:0 "Arctic Fleet"
 BJA_arctic_fleet_desc:0 "While the icy waters to our North aren't the most likely place to make a powerful fleet, it is undeniable that we would benefit from making the Arctic into a Bjarmian Lake."

 LIA_battle_of_qatwan:0 "Battle of Qatwan"
 LIA_battle_of_qatwan_desc:0 "After Yelü Dashi and his Liao exiles defeated the Qarakhanid Khanate during their invasion of Central Asia, the Qarakhanid Khan called upon his overlord in the Seljuq Empire for aid, who promptly marched to Samarqand with a force of 100.000 men, led personally by the Seljuq sultan.\n\nYelü Dashi, despite only having a force barely a third as large, chose to attack the Seljuqs head-on. He wisely divided his armies and attacked all at once, encircling the Seljuqs and forcing their center into a valley where they were surrounded and destroyed. Many of the Seljuq Emirs perished in the disastrous battle, though the Sultan narrowly managed to escape and flee to Balkh with the remnants of his army.\n\nThe crushing victory over the Seljuqs cemented our power in Central Asia and started the historic rivalry between us and the Seljuqs, one that continues to this day."
 LIA_liao_religious_freedom:0 "Liao Religious Freedom"
 LIA_liao_religious_freedom_desc:0 "Central Asia is a land of many religions. Our subjects practice Islam, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, Nestorianism, and much more. Ourselves being not adherent to any of these faiths, we have made efforts to ensure that every subject of the Empire is able to practice their religion freely without intervention from the Imperial Government."
 LIA_gunpowder_empire:0 "The Gunpowder Empire"
 LIA_gunpowder_empire_desc:0 "Rifles, Cannons, Rockets, Mines: The Liao Arsenal has become filled with weapons of gunpowder.\nThe wars in Europe have made the power of firearms and artillery obvious for all to see, and yet, many states still continue to cling on to ancient ways of war. Let their failure be our advantage, the Liao will become experts in the ways of modern warfare."
 LIA_silk_crossroads:0 "Silk Crossroads"
 LIA_silk_crossroads_desc:0 "The Silk Road has rarely ever been so prosperous. Our campaigns of conquest and pacification have revitalized the old trans-eurasian trade routes between the Steppes, Arabia, India and China, and as the (literal) middlemen in these mercantile arrangements, we are able to command a great deal of influence in the realm of trade."
 LIA_bureaucratic_empire:0 "Bureaucratic Empire"
 LIA_bureaucratic_empire_desc:0 "The heart of the Liao has always been it's bureaucracy. It is this administrative monster that keeps our incredibly diverse and vast realm united and running smoothly in the face of rebellion, famine, chaos and war. As long as the bureaucracy keeps running, so does the Great Liao."
 LIA_economic_planning:0 "Economic Planning"
 LIA_economic_planning_desc:0 "The state does not bend to greedy merchants and bankers. Though they may claim that the economy is best left to those who know it as well as they do, we cannot trust them to always make the best decision for the Empire. The Government must take a more active role in ensuring prosperity for it's myriad subjects, starting in the realm of economics."
 LIA_imperial_reorganization:0 "Era of Imperial Reorganization"
 LIA_imperial_reorganization_desc:0 "The 'Era of Imperial Reorganization' (1773 - 1858) was a time of great upheaval in the Empire. The once powerful Imperial Army had stagnated, made clear for all to see during failed military campaigns in the upper Nile and southern India, while the long-standing policy of bureaucratic centralism had become less and less respected in the face of growing bureaucratic corruption.\n\nBy 1773 however, Emperor Yelü Zhou had grown fed up with the complacency of imperial officials, and ordered that a grand purge of corrupt officials be conducted. With the aid of other reform-oriented minds at the court, the purge was successful, and Emperor Zhou subsequently declared an 'Era of Imperial Reorganization', calling on scholars and officials to come to the capital at Xijing and voice their concerns and recommendations directly at the court. Though initially many were suspicious, believing this to be a way of purging anti-imperial individuals, their worries were eventually proven wrong as Emperor Zhou increasingly began adopting many of the recommendations made.\n\nThough the Reformer-Emperor eventually passed in 1806, the Era of Imperial Reorganization continued. The finance and banking systems were overhauled and modernized, criminal and civil codes were updated, new ministries were established, homosexuality and several traditions previously considered 'barbarian' were legalized, an Imperial Citizenship was established, and much more."

 SMR_liao_frontier:0 "Liao Frontier"
 SMR_liao_frontier_desc:0 "Samarqand is located on the very edge of the Great Liao, and beyond our borders lies the madman Caliph who would sooner destroy his own realm than make peace with Balashagun. Guarding the Frontier, holding until the last man: that is our duty to the Empire, and only in death does our duty end."
 SMR_restore_samarqand_observatory:0 "Restore the Observatory"
 SMR_restore_samarqand_observatory_desc:0 "There are many things humanity does not know about the operations of the stars and the sun, of the planets and the world. Though it may still be centuries until we can definitively know the answers to even a fraction of the questions that the stars hold, we can leave our mark on the road there by restoring the famous Samarqand Observatory, surely to become a place of great scientific advancements."
 SMR_bank_of_samarqand:0 "Bank of Samarqand"
 SMR_bank_of_samarqand_desc:0 "Samarqand has always lagged behind the rest of the Empire in economic terms. The region received less attention than most others from the Imperial Government, partially due to the awkward administrative arrangements surrounding the country. No more! Balashagun has at last established a government-backed moneylending institution with the expressed purpose of financing promising development projects in the region."
 SMR_liao_renaissance:0 "The Liao Renaissance"
 SMR_liao_renaissance_desc:0 "In few places is the Liao Renaissance more visible than in Samarqand. The influx of Persian and European scholars has brought about a golden age of culture and science, and we would be fools not to take advantage by hiring a few of these great minds."
 SMR_imperial_auxilliaries:0 "Imperial Auxilliaries"
 SMR_imperial_auxilliaries_desc:0 "Pacifying Persia in the aftermath of the Anxi Wars was never going to be easy. As the continued resistance began to take a toll on the Liao forces, they increasingly called upon soldiers from Samarqand to serve in the pacification campaign. Many of these men have returned home as experienced veterans, bringing a great benefit to our military capabilities."
 SMR_metropolitanate_of_samarqand:0 "Metropolitanate of Samarqand"
 SMR_metropolitanate_of_samarqand_desc:0 "The Nestorian Church has a complicated relationship with Samarqand. The majority of our population follows their faith, but rebellion would only bring about Imperial intervention. As such, both parties have mostly chosen to work with each other rather than to fight each other: the Nestorians are able to practice their religion with little restrictions, and in exchange we get to take advantage of the Church's extensive connections in the Imperial Court and the christian communities all across the Middle East." 
 SMR_northern_capital:0 "The Northern Capital"
 SMR_northern_capital_desc:0 "Though the Liao's center of power eventually shifted out of Central Asia and into Mesopotamia, Samarqand's influence as a major trade city and popular vacation destination for Emperors remained. This arrangement of the city being an unofficial second capital was legitimized when the city was declared the Northern Capital of the Liao, and Samarqand (now 'Beijing') only continued to gain in renown afterwards."

 SUH_suhraltanubi_trade_desc:0 "Living just beyond the Spice Islands, the people of Suhraltanubia have over time developed a strong maritime and mercantile culture. From Malacca to Guangzhou, there is scarcely a harbour in East Asia where you cannot find a Suhraltanubi trader."
 SUH_crab_fighting:0 "Crab Fighting"
 SUH_crab_fighting_desc:0 "Ready, Set, Go!!\n\nDue to the oppressive heat and lack of vast swathes of agricultural land, cock-fighting can't be supported as a sport in the vast majority of the nation, therefore to the beaches it is! Inspired by tales of giant Crabs living on an island to the west, Crab-fighting is a new sport, wherein the fiercest crabs with the biggest claws are made to fight in an enclosed ring. There are numerous different games of winning, such as whoever loses an arm/leg first or whoever gets flipped over first being the two most popular iterations! This new sport will spread across the Walythian Islands, and be enjoyed by all for generations to come!"
 SUH_outback_ranchers:0 "Frontier Ranchers"
 SUH_outback_ranchers_desc:0 "The interior of Suhraltanubia is vast and sparsely populated. Despite this, our people continue to settle further and further inland, creating vast livestock farms in the inland. These ranches are able to autonomously develop their land where the government is unable to, turning a vast dry grassland into a profitable grazing area."
 SUH_el_diab:0 "Walbreieu el-Diab"
 SUH_el_diab_desc:0 "The name Walbreieu el-Diab is one that every Suhraltanubi will immediately recognize, for there have been few greater minds to ever inhabit this world.\n\nIn a voyage funded by the Akgulid Caliph, el-Diab set out from the Red Sea for the Spice Islands and then his homeland of Suhraltanubia. From here, he set sail for the recently discovered Hawaiian archipelago and onwards further to the East, where he discovered strange wildlife and a great Empire, in contact with foreign explorers from the west. Sailing now towards the south along the newly discovered coast he eventually rounded the southern tip of the continent and sailed across the Atlantic for the Maghreb, where he crossed the straits of Gibraltar under the cover of darkness and finally arriving in the Akgulid harbour of Alexandria.\n\nHe will go down in the pages of history as a great explorer, as the first man to sail a fleet around the globe, and his example will inspire many Suhraltanubi even long after his death."
 SUH_polynesian_integration:0 "Polynesian Integration"
 SUH_polynesian_integration_desc:0 "The people of Walytha are diverse and distant from another, creating a vast array of unique traditions and cultures. To create a truly Walythan state, we must learn from, convert, and integrate all of them."
 SUH_walythian_empire:0 "Walythan Empire"
 SUH_walythian_empire_desc:0 "The Walytha Ocean is vast, and it's islands are many. If we are to rule and defend such a vast and fractured land, we must construct the greatest fleet the world has ever seen. Walytha shall remain free!"
 SUH_marine_corps:0 "Suhraltanubi Marines"
 SUH_marine_corps_desc:0 "Fighting in Walytha is vastly different than in the great landmasses of Eurasia and Avalon. Land warfare plays second fiddle to control of the seas, and even when it happens, few islands are large enough to allow for large armies to fight organized battles.\n\nUnlike the continental powers, we have long adapted to this insular style of warfare. Not only are our regular soldiers faster at boarding and unboarding, we have also established the famous Suhraltanubi Marines, a corps of elite soldiers specializing in naval landings and insular warfare."

 SUH_suhraltanubi_trade_desc:0 "Living just beyond the Spice Islands, the people of Suhraltanubia have over time developed a strong maritime and mercantile culture. From Malacca to Guangzhou, there is scarcely a harbour in East Asia where you cannot find a Suhraltanubi trader."
 SUH_crab_fighting:0 "Crab Fighting"
 SUH_crab_fighting_desc:0 "Ready, Set, Go!!\n\nDue to the oppressive heat and lack of vast swathes of agricultural land, cock-fighting can't be supported as a sport in the vast majority of the nation, therefore to the beaches it is! Inspired by tales of giant Crabs living on an island to the west, Crab-fighting is a new sport, wherein the fiercest crabs with the biggest claws are made to fight in an enclosed ring. There are numerous different games of winning, such as whoever loses an arm/leg first or whoever gets flipped over first being the two most popular iterations! This new sport will spread across the Walythian Islands, and be enjoyed by all for generations to come!"
 SUH_outback_ranchers:0 "Frontier Ranchers"
 SUH_outback_ranchers_desc:0 "The interior of Suhraltanubia is vast and sparsely populated. Despite this, our people continue to settle further and further inland, creating vast livestock farms in the inland. These ranches are able to autonomously develop their land where the government is unable to, turning a vast dry grassland into a profitable grazing area."
 SUH_el_diab:0 "Walbreieu el-Diab"
 SUH_el_diab_desc:0 "The name Walbreieu el-Diab is one that every Suhraltanubi will immediately recognize, for there have been few greater minds to ever inhabit this world.\n\nIn a voyage funded by the Akgulid Caliph, el-Diab set out from the Red Sea for the Spice Islands and then his homeland of Suhraltanubia. From here, he set sail for the recently discovered Hawaiian archipelago and onwards further to the East, where he discovered strange wildlife and a great Empire, in contact with foreign explorers from the west. Sailing now towards the south along the newly discovered coast he eventually rounded the southern tip of the continent and sailed across the Atlantic for the Maghreb, where he crossed the straits of Gibraltar under the cover of darkness and finally arriving in the Akgulid harbour of Alexandria.\n\nHe will go down in the pages of history as a great explorer, as the first man to sail a fleet around the globe, and his example will inspire many Suhraltanubi even long after his death."
 SUH_polynesian_integration:0 "Polynesian Integration"

 SUH_walythian_empire_desc:0 "The Walytha Ocean is vast, and it's islands are many. If we are to rule and defend such a vast and fractured land, we must construct the greatest fleet the world has ever seen. Walytha shall remain free!"
 SUH_marine_corps:0 "Suhraltanubi Marines"
 SUH_marine_corps_desc:0 "Fighting in Walytha is vastly different than in the great landmasses of Eurasia and Avalon. Land warfare plays second fiddle to control of the seas, and even when it happens, few islands are large enough to allow for large armies to fight organized battles.\n\nUnlike the continental powers, we have long adapted to this insular style of warfare. Not only are our regular soldiers faster at boarding and unboarding, we have also established the famous Suhraltanubi Marines, a corps of elite soldiers specializing in naval landings and insular warfare."

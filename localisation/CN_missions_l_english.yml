 nog_fourth_capital_title:0 "The Fourth Capital"
 nog_fourth_capital_desc:0 "The current Nogai capital of Saray-Juk is the fourth for the horde elite in the steppe, with the Manghud having followed the Mongol leadership from Syghnak to Sarai to Agyidel. We should develop this new capital to as acceptable a condition as the previous three, and maybe reaffirm or deny its legitimacy in bearing such an honor."
 nog_steppe_wealth_title:0 "Wealth of the Steppe"
 nog_steppe_wealth_desc:0 "While at first glance the steppe seems barren and distraught, there is opportunity to be made here. Riches flow from east to west and west to east, the non-nomadic provide ample opportunties for plunder, and we have some native goods to speak of. If we start to stuff our coffers then it is likely more wealth will follow."
 nog_proclaim_ambition_title:0 "Proclaim our Ambition"
 nog_proclaim_ambition_desc:0 "For decades has the Nogai Horde lied relatively passively. The end of the revolt against the Western Mongols also signified the end of conquest, as petty border raids and wars of little significance depleted the prestige of the region - our nation included. It is time for the Nogai to proclaim their ambition, to proclaim that glorious days lie ahead!"
 nog_prove_might_title:0 "Prove our Might"
 nog_prove_might_desc:0 "It is not enough that we simply flex our muscles - we must use them. The time has come for Nogai armies and bands to sprawl across the great steppe and display our absolute power to our enemies."
 nog_prepare_title:0 "Prepare for Conquest"
 nog_prepare_desc:0 "No conquest is done without an army, and the vast steppe before us requires an appropriately vast army. Let us build up as strong a force as we can muster and prepare for conquest."
 nog_subjugate_kazakhs_title:0 "Subjugate the Kazakhs"
 nog_subjugate_kazakhs_desc:0 "The Kazakh Khanate is largely defeated, governing a minority of Kazakhs in Central Asia. Within our borders is a large amount of that population, ready to be unified with their eastern kin, under a Nogai Khan, of course. It would be wise to tie this loose end before marching onwards."
 nog_capture_astrakhan_title:0 "Capture of Astrakhan"
 nog_capture_astrakhan_desc:0 "The capture of Astrakhan is one of the most important events facing our horde. The Volga city is the gateway to the Pontic Steppe, to Caucasia, and even partly into Scythia. Such a strategically, culturally, and economically important city has only one rightful ruler: The Firstborn Kipchak."

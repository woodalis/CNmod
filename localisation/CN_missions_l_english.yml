 nog_fourth_capital_desc:0 "The current Nogai capital of Saray-Juk is the fourth for the horde elite in the steppe, with the Manghud having followed the Mongol leadership from Syghnak to Sarai to Agyidel. We should develop this new capital to as acceptable a condition as the previous three, and maybe reaffirm or deny its legitimacy in bearing such an honor."

 nog_steppe_wealth_desc:0 "While at first glance the steppe seems barren and distraught, there is opportunity to be made here. Riches flow from east to west and west to east, the non-nomadic provide ample opportunties for plunder, and we have some native goods to speak of. If we start to stuff our coffers then it is likely more wealth will follow."

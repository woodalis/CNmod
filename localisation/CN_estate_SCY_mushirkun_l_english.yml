 estate_SCY_mushirkun_desc:0 "Mushirkun are those who commit the sin of shirk, those who reject monotheism. Scythia's position on the frontier of the dar al-Tawhid has brought under it a small yet significant minority of Buddhists, Ukonuskoists and other polytheists. They live in a delicate balance, having their rights undermined by the conservative Ulema and encroaching Orthodox Christians and only haven't been extinguished due to the power struggle between the Ulema and the Orthodox Church."
